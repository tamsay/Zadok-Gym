# Zadok-Gym

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/48ff0b9f-8d43-420c-912f-74a815f8ea6a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kind-kilby-b4b6c4/deploys)

A sample website built for the gym where I play my most favorite sport - Badminton. I started the project early January this year and achieved 90% completion. I finally completed the project this month (July). 

I used a dark themed design and used video carousel at the top segment of the site. The introductory/profile paragraph was animated via Javascript. Find below the before and after pictures of the site
